# Recalibrate the recurrency
Owing to WXS covering most of exons, most of regulatory regions are not covered. The mutaton recurrency should not be calculated as $ mutation recurrency / total sample $. I need to find out how many samples have enough read covered to this mutation site.

I use `samtools mpileup` to convert regional bams to mpileup files. they contain the depth of every regulatory position. Using `samtools` will encount the problem that it counts depth excluding duplicates, then the samtools may underestimate the depth of certain position.

`bedtools genomecov -bg` doesn't consider the reads flag, it count depth as reads covering the position. `-bg` paramter leaves out the region unmapped and it's faster than `-d`.


## Import result file
```{r import file}
f<-'/home/cliu18/liucj/projects/1.Mutation_calling_in_non-condig_region_through_EXOME/5.recalibrateRecurrencyWithCoverage/LUAD/SNP/refined_goc/refined.recurrency'

recur <- read.table(f, header = F, sep = "\t")

recur <- as_data_frame(recur)

colnames(recur) <- c("No.cov", "recurr", "chrom","pos")

recur <- mutate(recur, rate = recurr / No.cov)

# Recurrent rate distribution
ggplot(data= recur, aes(x= "rate", y = rate)) + geom_boxplot()

# Select recurrent rate

recur0.1 <- filter(recur, rate > 0.1)
ggplot(data= recur0.1, aes(x= "rate", y = rate)) + geom_boxplot()

write.table(recur0.1, file = "/home/cliu18/liucj/projects/1.Mutation_calling_in_non-condig_region_through_EXOME/5.recalibrateRecurrencyWithCoverage/LUAD/SNP/refined_goc/recur0.1", col.names = T, row.names = F, quote = F, sep = "\t")

dataPath <- '/home/cliu18/liucj/projects/1.Mutation_calling_in_non-condig_region_through_EXOME/4.compare_tumor_normal/LUAD/SNP'

somatic5 <- read.table(file = file.path(dataPath,"LUAD.somatic5.recurrency"),sep = "\t", header = T)

somatic5.recur0.1 <- recur0.1 %>% left_join(somatic5, by = c('chrom', 'pos'))

write.table(somatic5.recur0.1, file = "/home/cliu18/liucj/projects/1.Mutation_calling_in_non-condig_region_through_EXOME/5.recalibrateRecurrencyWithCoverage/LUAD/SNP/refined_goc/somatic5.recur0.1", col.names = T, row.names = F, quote = F, sep = "\t")
